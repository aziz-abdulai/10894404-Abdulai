        <h1>WELCOME TO MY HOMEPAGE</h1>
        <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Aziz" title="Aziz">
        <p>I am Abdulai Aziz twenty two years of age likes watching anime and movies. I am into sports.
            When I was a kid, I like school and respecting all my teachers. I am about seven feet tall and
            and 200 pounds. In January 2021, I made my way to the University of Ghana to pursue a degree in Information Technology (IT).
            That has been my dream for the past 15 years and I am so happy that i am finally pursuing my dream. Hopefully, when I graduate by 2024, I would have developed about
            200 applications that will change the world. Also, apart from my dream in IT, I would also like to play football for Manchester City (ManCity) in the position of a midfielder where i will grow to become the number 1.
            In all seriousness, I will achieve all my goals and dreams and become whatever i wish to become and no one can stop me. BELIEVE IT!
